🔍 TAB SWITCHING TIMER FIX TEST
===============================

This script helps you test if the timer continues running when you switch tabs.

🎯 TESTING PROCEDURE:
====================

1. 🌐 OPEN YOUR APP:
   - Go to http://localhost:5173
   - Open browser DevTools Console (F12)
   - Make sure you're logged in

2. 🎯 START TIMER:
   - Select a task or create a new one
   - Start the Pomodoro timer
   - Note the current time in the tab title (e.g., "25:00 - Fix...")

3. 📱 TEST TAB SWITCHING:
   - Switch to a different tab (like the terminal tab you're reading this from)
   - Wait 30-60 seconds
   - Switch back to the timer tab
   
4. ✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS:
   - Tab title time has decreased properly (e.g., "24:00 - Fix...")
   - You see this log in console: "📱 Tab became visible - checking for lost time"
   - If time was lost, you'll see: "⏰ Compensating for X missed seconds due to tab throttling"
   - Timer continues counting down properly

5. ❌ FAILURE INDICATORS:
   - Tab title time hasn't changed or shows wrong time
   - Timer appears "stuck" at the same time
   - No compensation logs appear

6. 🔍 CONSOLE COMMANDS TO HELP DEBUG:
   
   // Check current timer state
   console.log('Timer State:', {
     isRunning: useTimerStore.getState().isRunning,
     currentTime: useTimerStore.getState().currentTime,
     isActiveDevice: useTimerStore.getState().isActiveDevice
   });
   
   // Check page visibility
   console.log('Page Visibility:', document.visibilityState);
   
   // Force visibility change handler (for testing)
   document.dispatchEvent(new Event('visibilitychange'));

7. 🧪 ADVANCED TEST:
   - Open timer in multiple browser tabs
   - Only ONE tab should be the "active device"
   - Other tabs should show inactive state
   - Only the active tab should count down

🔧 WHAT THE COMPREHENSIVE FIX DOES:
====================================
- **Multi-layered Timer System**: Uses 3 different timing mechanisms simultaneously
  1. setInterval (primary)
  2. setTimeout chains (throttling-resistant)
  3. RequestAnimationFrame (visual updates)
- **Advanced Recovery System**: Detects and compensates for lost time using multiple triggers
- **Real-time Calculation**: Tracks actual elapsed time vs timer countdown for drift detection
- **Multiple Event Listeners**: visibility, focus, mousemove for comprehensive recovery
- **Aggressive Compensation**: Can recover up to 30 minutes of lost time

🏆 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
===============================
✅ Timer continues running even when tab is not active
✅ Time is compensated when you return to the tab
✅ Smooth timer experience across tab switches
✅ Tab title always shows correct countdown time

❌ OLD BROKEN BEHAVIOR (should be fixed now):
==============================================
❌ Timer would stop when tab loses focus
❌ Tab title would freeze at the same time
❌ No compensation for missed time

🚀 RUN THIS TEST NOW:
=====================
Start your timer and try switching tabs!
The fix should handle browser throttling automatically.
