### Task Management with Automatic Work Session Cleanup

When deleting tasks, the system now automatically:

- **Deletes all related work sessions** for the task to prevent orphaned data
- **Maintains dashboard accuracy** by removing work session data that would otherwise show inflated focus times
- **Provides cleanup utility** for existing orphaned sessions via the "Data Maintenance" section in the Average Focus Time widget

#### Usage

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: When you delete a task through the UI, all related work sessions are automatically deleted
2. **Manual Cleanup**: Use the "Cleanup Orphaned Sessions" button in the Average Focus Time widget to clean existing orphaned data

#### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Enhanced deleteTask function in taskStore.ts
deleteTask: async (id) => {
  // 1. Get user context
  const { user } = useUserStore.getState();
  
  // 2. Delete all related work sessions first
  const workSessions = await workSessionService.getWorkSessionsByTask(user.uid, id);
  await Promise.all(workSessions.map(session => 
    workSessionService.deleteWorkSession(session.id)
  ));
  
  // 3. Delete the task itself
  await deleteDoc(doc(db, 'tasks', id));
}
```

#### Benefits

- **Data Integrity**: No more orphaned work sessions causing dashboard mismatches
- **Accurate Analytics**: Dashboard widgets show correct focus time calculations
- **Maintenance Tools**: Built-in utility to fix existing data issues

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- NPM or Yarn
- Supabase account (for authentication and database features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/make10000hours.git
cd make10000hours
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Configure Supabase
   - Create a Supabase project at [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Go to Settings > API in your Supabase project
   - Copy the URL and anon key
   - Use our setup script to configure your environment:
   ```bash
   node setup-env.js
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to enter your Supabase URL and anon key
   - Alternatively, create a `.env` file manually with the following content:
   ```
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Authentication Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with authentication:

1. Check the browser console for Supabase connection errors
2. Verify your environment variables are set correctly
3. Make sure your Supabase project has Email/Password authentication enabled
4. If you see placeholder errors, run the setup script again to update your credentials
