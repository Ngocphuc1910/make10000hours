# Google Calendar Sync Setup Guide

## üîç Current Issue

Your sync feature is working perfectly, but it's running in **demo/mock mode**. This means:

- ‚úÖ Sync logic is working correctly
- ‚úÖ Tasks are being processed for sync
- ‚úÖ All status indicators work
- ‚ùå **No actual Google Calendar events are created** (only simulated)

## üö´ Why It's Not Working with Real Google Calendar

The current implementation uses Firebase Auth, which only provides basic Google profile access. To sync with Google Calendar, you need:

1. **Google Calendar API credentials** (separate from Firebase)
2. **OAuth2 scope for calendar access** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`)
3. **Proper OAuth2 flow** to get calendar access tokens
4. **Google Cloud Console setup** for Calendar API

## ‚úÖ How to Enable Real Google Calendar Sync

### Step 1: Google Cloud Console Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your existing Firebase project (or create new one)
3. Enable the **Google Calendar API**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Calendar API"
   - Click "Enable"

### Step 2: OAuth2 Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. Choose "Web application"
4. Add authorized origins:
   - `http://localhost:5173` (for development)
   - Your production domain
5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`
   - Your production auth callback URL
6. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth2_client_id
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth2_client_secret
```

### Step 4: Update Auth Configuration

The current implementation would need these changes:

1. **Separate OAuth2 flow** for Google Calendar (different from Firebase Auth)
2. **Store refresh tokens** to maintain calendar access
3. **Handle token refresh** when access tokens expire

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Demo Fix (Show Real API Calls)

For immediate testing, I can modify the code to show you what the real API calls would look like, even though they'll fail without proper OAuth setup.

## üìã Current Status Summary

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ User authentication (Firebase)
- ‚úÖ Task management and scheduling
- ‚úÖ Sync state management
- ‚úÖ Sync status indicators
- ‚úÖ Error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Conflict resolution logic
- ‚úÖ All UI components

**What's Missing for Real Google Calendar:**
- ‚ùå Google Calendar OAuth2 setup
- ‚ùå Calendar API credentials
- ‚ùå Proper access token management
- ‚ùå Production OAuth2 flow

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete Google Calendar Setup
- Follow the setup guide above
- Implement proper OAuth2 flow
- Update code to use real API credentials

### Option 2: Demo with Logging
- Keep current demo mode
- Add detailed logging to show what would happen
- Use for demonstration and testing purposes

### Option 3: Alternative Calendar Integration
- Consider other calendar APIs (Outlook, Apple Calendar)
- Use calendar file exports/imports
- Integration with other productivity tools
