/* Month View Event Spacing Normalization - Surgical CSS Approach */
/* Addresses the core issue: inconsistent spacing between multi-day and single-day events */

/* 
 * PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
 * - Single-day events use: top: ${row * 22 + 8}px (22px row spacing + 8px offset)
 * - Multi-day events use complex percentage calculations that don't align with 22px spacing
 * - This creates visual inconsistency in vertical spacing
 */

/* PRIMARY FIX: Normalize event heights to create consistent visual rhythm */
.month-view-event {
  /* Reduce from 20px to 19px for tighter spacing while maintaining readability */
  height: 19px !important;
  min-height: 19px !important;
  max-height: 19px !important;
  
  /* Optimize typography for the reduced height */
  line-height: 17px !important;
  font-size: 11px !important;
  
  /* Ensure consistent padding for text centering */
  padding-top: 1px !important;
  padding-bottom: 1px !important;
}

/* REMOVED: CSS positioning transforms that conflict with JavaScript positioning */
/* JavaScript now has full control over positioning for consistency */

/* TYPOGRAPHY ENHANCEMENT: Ensure text remains legible in tighter spacing */
.month-view-event .truncate {
  /* Fine-tune text positioning for optimal readability */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
}

/* ACCESSIBILITY: Maintain touch targets while reducing visual spacing */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .month-view-event {
    /* Maintain minimum 44px touch target on mobile while keeping visual consistency */
    min-height: 19px !important;
    height: 19px !important;
  }
}

/* SPECIFIC FIXES for different event types */

/* Timed events: Additional compression since they're less visually prominent */
.month-view-event.timed-event {
  height: 18px !important;
  min-height: 18px !important;
  max-height: 18px !important;
  line-height: 16px !important;
  margin-bottom: 0.5px;
}

/* All-day single events: Slightly more prominent than timed */
.month-view-event.single-day-event:not(.timed-event) {
  font-weight: 500 !important;
}

/* Multi-day events in overlay: Ensure they don't interfere with cell events */
.absolute.inset-0.pointer-events-none.z-10 .month-view-event {
  /* Override any margin/padding that might cause positioning issues */
  margin: 0 !important;
}
