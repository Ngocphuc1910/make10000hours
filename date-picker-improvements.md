# Date Picker Positioning Improvements

## Summary

Fixed the date picker display issue to ensure it's always fully visible on screen by implementing an intelligent positioning system with fallback strategies.

## Key Changes

### 1. **New Smart Positioning Hook** (`src/hooks/useSmartPosition.ts`)
- **Intelligent positioning logic** that considers viewport boundaries
- **Multiple fallback strategies**: tries preferred placement, opposite placement, then modal mode
- **Responsive to content changes** using MutationObserver
- **Smooth animations** with proper transform origins

### 2. **Enhanced DatePicker Component** (`src/components/common/DatePicker/DatePicker.tsx`)
- **Integrated smart positioning** using the new hook
- **Modal mode support** with backdrop for very constrained spaces
- **Better event handling** for clicks outside and escape key
- **Improved animations** with placement-aware classes
- **Dynamic styling** based on positioning context

### 3. **Simplified TaskForm Integration** (`src/components/tasks/TaskForm.tsx`)
- **Removed duplicate positioning logic** that was conflicting
- **Cleaner implementation** using DatePicker's built-in positioning
- **Better prop interface** with onClose callback

### 4. **Enhanced CSS Animations** (`src/index.css`)
- **Slide animations** for different placement directions
- **Enhanced shadows** and backdrop effects
- **Focus-within styling** for better accessibility

## Features

### Smart Positioning Algorithm
1. **Calculates available space** in all directions
2. **Tries preferred placement** (bottom by default)
3. **Falls back to opposite placement** if needed
4. **Uses modal mode** for extremely constrained spaces
5. **Considers transform origins** for smooth animations

### Positioning Modes
- **Bottom placement**: Default, with slide-down animation
- **Top placement**: When no space below, with slide-up animation  
- **Modal mode**: Centered with backdrop when space is very limited

### Responsive Features
- **Real-time repositioning** on scroll, resize, and orientation change
- **Content-aware updates** when time toggle changes picker height
- **Viewport boundary detection** with configurable padding
- **Smooth transitions** between positions

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern browsers**: Full support with all features
- **Older browsers**: Graceful degradation with basic positioning
- **Mobile devices**: Touch-friendly with modal fallback

## Performance Optimizations

- **RequestAnimationFrame** for smooth updates
- **Event delegation** to minimize listeners
- **Mutation observer** for efficient content change detection
- **Cleanup handlers** to prevent memory leaks

## Usage Example

```tsx
<DatePicker
  selectedDate={date}
  onDateSelect={handleDateSelect}
  triggerRef={buttonRef}
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}
  includeTime={true}
  // Smart positioning is automatic
/>
```

The date picker will now:
- ✅ Always stay within viewport boundaries
- ✅ Automatically reposition when content changes
- ✅ Use modal mode when space is very limited
- ✅ Provide smooth animations for all placements
- ✅ Handle edge cases like very small screens
