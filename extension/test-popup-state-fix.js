/**
 * Test Script for Popup State Persistence Fix
 * 
 * PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
 * The issue was in BlockingManager.loadState() method which was overwriting
 * the correct focusMode from internal state with a potentially stale value
 * from the direct storage key.
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE:
 * Line: this.focusMode = result.focusMode !== undefined ? result.focusMode : this.focusMode;
 * This would overwrite the correctly loaded internal state with stale data.
 * 
 * FIX APPLIED:
 * - Made blockingManagerState the single source of truth
 * - Removed the problematic overwrite line
 * - Added comprehensive debug logging to track state flow
 * 
 * TEST INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 1. Load the extension in Chrome (chrome://extensions -> Load unpacked -> select extension folder)
 * 2. Open popup (click extension icon)
 * 3. Toggle Deep Focus ON (switch should turn green/blue)
 * 4. Close popup (click outside or press Escape)
 * 5. Verify blocking works (try accessing facebook.com - should be blocked)
 * 6. Reopen popup (click extension icon again)
 * 7. ‚úÖ VERIFY: Deep Focus switch should still be ON (green/blue)
 * 
 * DEBUG LOGGING:
 * Check browser console (F12) for logs with these prefixes:
 * - [POPUP-DEBUG] - Popup initialization and UI updates
 * - [BACKGROUND-DEBUG] - Background message handling  
 * - [BLOCKING-DEBUG] - BlockingManager state persistence
 * 
 * EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
 * - BlockingManager maintains focusMode=true correctly
 * - GET_CURRENT_STATE returns accurate focusMode=true
 * - Popup displays correct switch state when reopened
 * - Sites remain blocked as expected
