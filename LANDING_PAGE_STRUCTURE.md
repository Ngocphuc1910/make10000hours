## 💡 **PROBLEM AGITATION**

### **The Hidden Productivity Killer**

Are you tired of...
- ✗ Starting focus sessions but forgetting to stop the timer when you grab coffee?
- ✗ Wondering where your 8-hour workday actually went?  
- ✗ Having 15 productivity apps that don't talk to each other?
- ✗ Saying "I'll start that big project tomorrow" for the 47th time?

**The brutal truth:** You're not lazy. Your current system is broken.

Most productivity apps treat the symptom (poor time tracking) instead of the disease (lack of integrated focus systems). You end up with inflated "focus time" that includes your lunch break and a confused understanding of where you're actually productive.
