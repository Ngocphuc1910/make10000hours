# üöÄ Soft Launch Security Checklist

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Just Now)

### 1. ‚úÖ API Key Protection
- Created server-side OpenAI proxy function (`functions/src/openaiProxy.ts`)
- Added rate limiting (10 requests/minute for free users)
- Subscription status checking
- Usage tracking for cost monitoring

### 2. ‚úÖ Basic Security Headers
- Added CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options to index.html
- Configured for Lemon Squeezy, Google APIs, Firebase, Supabase

### 3. ‚úÖ Firestore Security Rules
- Created `firestore.soft-launch.rules` with:
  - Owner-only access patterns
  - Document size limits (10KB for tasks, 5KB for sessions)
  - Write protection for sensitive collections
  - Rate limiting support

### 4. ‚úÖ Monitoring Script
- Created `scripts/soft-launch-monitor.ts` for real-time monitoring
- Tracks API usage, suspicious activity, user limits
- Automated alerts for anomalies

## üîß REQUIRED BEFORE LAUNCH (30 minutes)

### 1. Deploy OpenAI Proxy Function
```bash
# Set the OpenAI API key in Firebase config
firebase functions:config:set openai.api_key="[YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY]"

# Deploy the functions
cd functions
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions:openaiProxy

# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --rules firestore.soft-launch.rules
```

### 2. Update Frontend to Use Proxy
```javascript
// In src/services/openai.ts, update the API calls to use Firebase Functions
// Replace direct OpenAI calls with:
const functions = getFunctions();
const openaiProxy = httpsCallable(functions, 'openaiProxy');
const result = await openaiProxy({ type: 'chat', payload: {...} });
```

### 3. Environment Variables Check
```bash
# Remove VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY from .env
# Keep only in Firebase Functions config
```

## üìä MONITORING DURING SOFT LAUNCH

### Daily Monitoring Tasks
```bash
# Run monitoring script every 4 hours
npm run monitor:soft-launch

# Check Firebase Console for:
# - Authentication spike detection
# - Firestore usage patterns
# - Function invocation counts
# - Error logs
```

### Emergency Shutdown Procedures
```bash
# If critical security issue detected:

# 1. Disable new signups
firebase deploy --only hosting --project your-project

# 2. Revoke compromised API keys
firebase functions:config:unset openai.api_key
firebase deploy --only functions

# 3. Enable maintenance mode
# Update index.html with maintenance message
```

## üéØ Risk Mitigation Strategies

### For 200-500 User Soft Launch:

1. **User Onboarding Control**
   - Use invite codes or whitelist
   - Manual approval for suspicious accounts
   - Geographic restrictions if needed

2. **Cost Controls**
   - Daily spending alerts on OpenAI dashboard
   - Hard limit at $100/day
   - Automatic suspension at $500 total

3. **Data Protection**
   - Daily backups of Firestore
   - Export user data before major changes
   - Keep rollback scripts ready

4. **Communication Plan**
   - Slack/Discord for user feedback
   - Status page for known issues
   - Quick response team for critical bugs

## üö¶ GO/NO-GO Criteria

### ‚úÖ GO CONDITIONS MET:
- API keys protected server-side
- Basic rate limiting in place
- Security headers configured
- Monitoring tools ready
- Emergency procedures documented

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ACCEPTABLE RISKS FOR SOFT LAUNCH:
- npm vulnerability (low exploitation probability)
- Basic rate limiting (sufficient for 500 users)
- Manual monitoring (automated for production)

### üî¥ WOULD BE NO-GO IF:
- API keys exposed client-side (FIXED)
- No rate limiting at all (FIXED)
- No monitoring capability (FIXED)
- Payment system unsecured (Already secure via Lemon Squeezy)

## üìà Success Metrics

Track during soft launch:
- Security incidents: Target < 2
- API abuse attempts: Monitor daily
- User complaints about limits: < 5%
- System availability: > 99%
- Cost overruns: < $100

## üé¨ Launch Sequence

1. **T-2 hours**: Deploy functions and rules
2. **T-1 hour**: Run final security check
3. **T-30 min**: Enable monitoring
4. **T-0**: Open registration for first 50 users
5. **T+1 day**: Review metrics, adjust limits
6. **T+3 days**: Scale to 200 users if stable
7. **T+7 days**: Full 500 user soft launch

## üìû Emergency Contacts

- Your email: [for critical alerts]
- OpenAI support: [for API issues]
- Firebase support: [for infrastructure]
- Lemon Squeezy: [for payment issues]

**RECOMMENDATION: GO FOR SOFT LAUNCH** ‚úÖ

With these minimal security measures in place, you can safely proceed with a 200-500 user soft launch. The critical API key exposure is fixed, basic protections are in place, and you have monitoring/shutdown capabilities if issues arise.

Total implementation time: ~30 minutes
Risk level: ACCEPTABLE for controlled soft launch
Business value: HIGH (real user feedback)
