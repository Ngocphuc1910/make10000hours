# Activity Detection & Auto-Session Management Testing Guide

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Enable Developer Console
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Monitor console logs for activity detection events
- Look for activity state changes: `üîç Activity state changed`

### 2. Verify Initial State
```typescript
// Check store state in console
const store = useDeepFocusStore.getState();
console.log('Initial state:', {
  isDeepFocusActive: store.isDeepFocusActive,
  autoSessionManagement: store.autoSessionManagement,
  isSessionPaused: store.isSessionPaused
});
```

### 3. Test Environment
- Use Deep Focus page (`/deep-focus`)
- Start a deep focus session
- Ensure auto-management toggle is enabled

## Core Functionality Tests

### Test 1: Basic Activity Detection
**Objective**: Verify activity events are properly detected

**Steps**:
1. Start deep focus session
2. Verify "Active" status shows with green icon
3. Move mouse, click, type
4. Monitor console for activity updates

**Expected**: 
- Status remains "Active"
- Console shows activity events
- No inactivity warnings

### Test 2: Inactivity Timeout
**Objective**: Test automatic session pausing

**Steps**:
1. Start deep focus session
2. Stop all activity (don't touch mouse/keyboard)
3. Wait 5+ minutes
4. Check session status

**Expected**:
- After 5 minutes: Status changes to "Paused (inactive)"
- Yellow icon appears
- Console shows: `‚è∞ Inactivity timeout detected`
- Console shows: `üõë Pausing deep focus session`

### Test 3: Activity Resumption
**Objective**: Test automatic session resumption

**Steps**:
1. Follow Test 2 to get paused session
2. Move mouse or click anywhere
3. Check session status immediately

**Expected**:
- Status changes to "Active" immediately
- Green icon returns
- Console shows: `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resuming deep focus session`

## System Event Tests

### Test 4: Browser Tab Switching
**Objective**: Test page visibility changes

- Session should be paused when returning
- Page visibility API detects sleep
- Session resumes on activity

### Test 8: Extended Inactivity
**Objective**: Test very long periods of inactivity

4. Check session status

**Expected**:
- Session remains "Active" despite inactivity
- No automatic pausing occurs
- Manual toggle takes precedence

### Test 10: Enable Auto-Management Mid-Session
**Objective**: Test enabling auto-management during active session

**Steps**:
1. Start session with auto-management disabled
2. Enable auto-management toggle
3. Wait 6+ minutes without activity

**Expected**:
- Auto-management activates immediately
- Session pauses after threshold
- Setting change takes effect without restart

## Edge Case Tests

### Test 11: Rapid Activity/Inactivity Cycles
**Objective**: Test system stability with frequent state changes

**Steps**:
1. Start deep focus session
2. Alternate between 1-minute activity and 6-minute inactivity
3. Repeat cycle 3-5 times

**Expected**:
- System handles rapid pause/resume cycles
- No memory leaks or timer conflicts
- Accurate time tracking maintained

### Test 12: Multiple Tab Instances
**Objective**: Test behavior with multiple deep focus tabs

**Steps**:
1. Open deep focus page in multiple tabs
2. Start session in one tab
3. Switch between tabs
4. Test inactivity in various tabs

**Expected**:
- Activity detection works across tabs
- State synchronizes between instances
- No conflicts between tabs

### Test 13: Network Disconnection
**Objective**: Test offline behavior

**Steps**:
1. Start deep focus session
2. Disconnect network
