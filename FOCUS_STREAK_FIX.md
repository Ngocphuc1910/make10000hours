# üî• **FOCUS STREAK DATA ISSUE - FIXED**

## **üîç Root Cause Identified**

**The Problem:**
- **Working sections** (Dashboard widgets): Use `transitionQueryService` ‚Üí Gets data from **both UTC and Legacy systems**
- **Broken section** (Focus Streak): Used `workSessionService` directly ‚Üí Only got data from **one system**

**Why Focus Streak only showed recent data:**
The Focus Streak store was directly calling `workSessionService.getWorkSessionsForRange()` which only accesses one collection, missing all the historical legacy data.

## **‚úÖ What Was Fixed**

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// Focus Streak store - ONLY got data from one system
const sessions = await workSessionService.getWorkSessionsForRange(
  userId, yearStart, yearEnd
);
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Focus Streak store - NOW gets data from BOTH systems
const unifiedSessions = await transitionQueryService.getSessionsForDateRangeOptimized(
  yearStart, yearEnd, userId, userTimezone
);
// Converts unified format back to WorkSession format for compatibility
```

## **üöÄ Immediate Resolution Steps**

### **Step 1: Clear Focus Streak Cache**
```javascript
// In browser console (on dashboard page):
window.localStorage.removeItem('focus-streak-cache');
```

### **Step 2: Refresh Page**
- Reload the dashboard page
- Focus Streak will now fetch data using the fixed method

### **Step 3: Verify Fix**
Look for these console messages:
```
FocusStreakStore - Using transitionQueryService for COMPLETE data (UTC + Legacy)
FocusStreakStore - Retrieved COMPLETE data: { 
  totalSessions: 245, 
  utcSessions: 45, 
  legacySessions: 200, 
  year: 2024 
}
```

## **üìä Expected Results**

**You should now see:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete historical streak data** from before UTC implementation
- ‚úÖ **All legacy focus sessions** included in streak calculation  
- ‚úÖ **Accurate current and longest streaks** spanning your entire history
- ‚úÖ **Full contribution grid** with all historical data points

## **üéØ Technical Details**

**Files Changed:**
- `src/store/focusStreakStore.ts` - Now uses `transitionQueryService` for complete data access

**Data Flow Fixed:**
1. Focus Streak requests year data
2. `transitionQueryService` queries **both** UTC and Legacy collections
3. Merges and deduplicates the results
4. Returns complete historical data
5. Focus Streak shows accurate streaks and contributions

**The optimization is maintained** - database-level filtering still works, but now Focus Streak gets complete data from both systems.

**Your focus streak history should now be fully restored!**
