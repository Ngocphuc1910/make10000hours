# User-Specific Deep Focus State Fix

## Problem
When multiple browser tabs are open with different user accounts, toggling deep focus in one tab affects the deep focus state in all other tabs, regardless of which user is authenticated in each tab.

## Root Cause
1. **Shared localStorage**: All tabs used the same `'deep-focus-storage'` key
2. **Extension broadcasts to all tabs**: Extension sends focus changes to ALL tabs without user context
3. **No user validation**: Focus state changes were processed without checking user authentication

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: User-Specific State Isolation ✅

#### 1. User-Specific Storage Keys
- **Before**: `'deep-focus-storage'` (shared across all users)
- **After**: `'deep-focus-storage-{userId}'` (isolated per user)
- **Fallback**: `'deep-focus-storage-anonymous'` for non-authenticated users

#### 2. Authentication Guards
Added user validation to all deep focus operations:
```typescript
// Authentication guard - prevent operation if user not authenticated
const { useUserStore } = await import('./userStore');
const user = useUserStore.getState().user;
if (!user?.uid) {
  console.warn('⚠️ User not authenticated - cannot enable deep focus');
  return;
}
```

#### 3. Extension User Context
- Extension content script now includes current user ID in messages
- Web app validates extension messages against current user
- Focus state changes are ignored if they're for a different user

#### 4. Storage Cleanup
- Previous user storage is cleared when switching users
- Prevents data leakage between user sessions

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
1. **`src/store/deepFocusStore.ts`**
   - Added user-specific storage key generation
   - Added authentication guards to `enableDeepFocus` and `disableDeepFocus`
   - Implemented storage cleanup helpers

2. **`src/hooks/useUserSync.ts`**
   - Added storage cleanup when user changes
   - Enhanced user sync logging with user context

3. **`extension/content.js`**
   - Added user ID validation for focus state changes
   - Enhanced message payload with user context

4. **`src/hooks/useDeepFocusSync.ts`**
   - Added user validation for extension messages
   - Focus changes are now filtered by user context

### Testing Utilities
5. **`src/utils/testUserSpecificDeepFocus.ts`** (New)
   - Test functions to verify user isolation
   - Helper functions for debugging multi-user scenarios

## Testing

### Console Testing
```javascript
// Run in browser console
testUserSpecificDeepFocus(); // Check current state
clearAllDeepFocusStorage();  // Reset for testing
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open app in Tab A, login as User A
2. Open app in Tab B, login as User B  
3. Enable deep focus in Tab A
4. Verify Tab B is NOT affected
5. Toggle deep focus in Tab B
6. Verify Tab A maintains its state

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **User A** enables deep focus → Only **User A's tabs** update  
✅ **User B** in another tab → Unaffected by User A's changes  
✅ **Storage isolation** → Each user has separate localStorage  
✅ **Extension sync** → Only syncs with authenticated user  
✅ **Database operations** → Remain user-specific as before  

## Backward Compatibility

- Anonymous users get fallback storage key
- Existing functionality preserved for single-user scenarios
- Database operations unchanged
- Extension API remains compatible

## Phase 2 Recommendations (Future)

1. **Database as Source of Truth**
   - Real-time Firestore listeners for focus state
   - Cross-device synchronization
   - Conflict resolution with timestamps

2. **Enhanced Extension Integration**
   - Per-user blocked site lists in extension
   - User-aware blocking rules
   - Better offline mode handling

## Verification

The fix can be verified by:
1. Checking localStorage keys are user-specific
2. Testing focus changes don't cross user boundaries  
3. Confirming extension messages include user context
4. Validating authentication guards prevent unauthorized operations
