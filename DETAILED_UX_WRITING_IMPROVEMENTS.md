## STYLE GUIDE ADDENDUM

### Voice Principles
1. **Encouraging, not demanding**: "Ready to focus?" not "You must focus"
2. **Clear, not clever**: "Save changes" not "Make it so"
3. **Human, not robotic**: "Oops, something went wrong" not "Error 500"
4. **Helpful, not condescending**: "Try entering a number" not "You entered it wrong"

### Grammar Rules
- Sentence case for UI elements
- No periods in short UI text (<5 words)
- Use periods for complete sentences
- Oxford comma in lists
- Active voice always

### Terminology Consistency
Always use:
- "Focus session" not "Pomodoro"
- "Tasks" not "To-dos"
- "Projects" not "Categories"
- "Insights" not "Analytics"
- "Focus Mode" not "Deep Focus"

This detailed guide provides specific, actionable copy changes for every component in your app, ensuring consistency and world-class UX writing throughout.
