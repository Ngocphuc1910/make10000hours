# UX Writing Improvement Report - Make 10,000 Hours

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the codebase and researching best practices from world-class products like Notion, Figma, Duolingo, and Todoist, I've identified several opportunities to enhance the UX writing throughout the app. The current writing is functional but lacks consistency, clarity, and the polished feel of premium productivity tools.

## Key Principles for World-Class UX Writing

Based on industry best practices for 2024:

1. **Be Concise**: Remove unnecessary words while maintaining clarity
2. **Use Active Voice**: Make instructions direct and actionable
3. **Be Consistent**: Use the same terminology throughout the app
4. **Be Human**: Write conversationally without being unprofessional
5. **Guide, Don't Command**: Help users understand what to do and why
6. **Be Inclusive**: Use language that works for all users
7. **Provide Context**: Explain why actions are needed, not just what to do
8. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Turn mistakes into helpful moments

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Technical functionality is solid
- Basic navigation labels are clear
- Some error handling exists

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. **Inconsistent Terminology**
- Multiple terms for same concepts: "Task Management" vs "Projects" vs "Tasks"
- Timer modes: "Pomodoro" vs "Work Session" vs "Focus Time"
- Sync states: "syncing" vs "loading" vs "recovering"

#### 2. **Technical/Developer-Focused Language**
- "Recovering task state..." → Should be "Getting your tasks ready..."
- "Connection error" → Should be "Can't connect right now. We'll keep trying."
- "Invalid input" → Should be "Please check this field"
- "uid" appearing in user-facing contexts

#### 3. **Missing Helpful Microcopy**
- No onboarding tooltips or first-time user guidance
- Empty states lack helpful suggestions
- Form fields missing helper text
- No contextual help for complex features

#### 4. **Unclear Button Labels**
- Generic "Submit", "Save", "Cancel" instead of specific actions
- "Start" vs "Begin" vs "Go" inconsistency
- Missing clarification on destructive actions

#### 5. **Poor Error Messages**
- Technical error codes shown to users
- No guidance on how to fix issues
- Missing recovery suggestions
- Alarming tone instead of helpful
